UPDATES from v0:

Version 1 of the L2SWBM historical record incorporates a couple of changes:

1.) Regarding the prior uncertainty and bias in the channel flow and diversion estimates, we incorporate more
precise expert opinion, based off of historical seasonal data. Some of that opinion is derived from Bruxer 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/11375/9907), while the rest was developed from informal conversation between Bruxer and Steinschneider (Cornell University). The proc and plotter files have been updated as a result.

2.) St. Clair is given more equal treatment in terms of seasonal process error and bias of its Net Basin Supplies.

These changes are summarized in a block of code in the proc* file:

*BiasPrec are calculated as follows:

(ySuperiorOutflow1BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.02,12)*superiorOutflowPriorMean)^2)
(ySuperiorOutflow2BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.02,12)*superiorOutflowPriorMean)^2)
(ySuperiorDiversion1BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.04,12)*superiorDiversionPriorMean)^2)
(yMiHuronOutflow1BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.03,12)*miHuronOutflowPriorMean)^2)
(yMiHuronOutflow2BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.03,12)*miHuronOutflowPriorMean)^2)
(yMiHuronDiversion1BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.04,12)*miHuronDiversionPriorMean)^2)
(yClairOutflow1BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.03,12)*clairOutflowPriorMean)^2)
(yClairOutflow2BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.03,12)*clairOutflowPriorMean)^2)
(yErieOutflow1BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.02,12)*erieOutflowPriorMean)^2)
(yErieDiversion1BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.04,12)*erieDiversionPriorMean)^2)
(yOntarioOutflow1BiasPrec = 1/(rep(0.02,12)*ontarioOutflowPriorMean)^2)

Where *PriorMean are calculated from historical observations. Each is a vector of 12 values for each month. The final precision values are based off of a percentage (2-4%) of those historical values, as informed by Bruxer and Steinschnieder.
